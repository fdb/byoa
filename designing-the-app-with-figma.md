# Designing the App with Figma

Figma is an online design application. We use Figma to create the design of our app and to plan its interaction. Using the Figma Mirror app (available for iOS or Android) we can immediately test the design of the app.

## Frames

To make new screens in Figma we use *frames*. When creating a frame, we can choose which device size we want to use. Don't worry too much about iPhone vs iPhone plus, we will work around this with React Native's layout system later.
