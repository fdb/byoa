# Designing the App with Figma

Figma is an online design application. We use Figma to create the design of our app and to plan its interaction. Using the Figma Mirror app (available for iOS or Android) we can immediately test the design of the app.

Schermen in Figma maken we aan door een nieuw frame te maken.

Getting started with app development requires an installation process that takes a while. Because the tooling space is quite young, a lot of the tools are in flux: new versions introduce incompatibilities, and things that used to work 6 months ago now no longer run. Obviously, this can be very frustrating if you just want to dive in and start writing an application.

Fortunately, if we just want to get started, we don't have to do all of this. We can build small React Native apps with nothing more than our smartphone and a web browser. Meet Expo Snack.
