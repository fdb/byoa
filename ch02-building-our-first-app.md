# Building Our First App

Expo Snack is very useful for small one-offs: experimenting with a certain control, trying out small style tweaks without installing anything, building apps on the go. However, for serious app development we probably need an environment that can contain multiple source files as well as assets such as images or sounds.

To do this we're going to install the Expo XDE on our machine. This is one step up from Expo Snack: we still have the convenience of running everything directly on our phone, but our project is now a self-contained folder on our computer.
